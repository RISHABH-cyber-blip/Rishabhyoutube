This is a beginner-friendly YouTube clone project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to replicate the core layout and basic functionality of the YouTube homepage â€” including a video grid, thumbnail previews, and a "Watch Later" feature. When users click on the Watch Later button, the selected video is saved using localStorage, and can later be viewed on a dedicated Watch Later page.

This project helped me understand:

How to structure a webpage using HTML and CSS

How to manage data with localStorage

How to use JavaScript modules and dynamically render content

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or use it as a base for your own learning and development!
